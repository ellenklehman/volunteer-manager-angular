#Volunteer Management System

This Ruby app allows organizers to create events and volunteers to sign up for them. Organizers must have a valid account to create, edit, or delete events, or to view volunteer details.

Install the program by cloning it, running bundle, creating a database, and running the migrations. You can also check it out on [Heroku] (http://volunteer-management-system.herokuapp.com).
